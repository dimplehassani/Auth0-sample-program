Spring Secutiry with AUTH0
https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/java-spring-security/01-authorization

we will develop the API's for our clients - REST API's

nobody will be allowed to access the API's without authentication and authorization

so client will register with AUTH0 to get the JWT tokens to access the resource API's -- this has a cost

REST API will be responsible to validate the token and enabling the security for the API's
